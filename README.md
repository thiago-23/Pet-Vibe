## Agile Methodology
GitHub Projects was used to manage the development process of the Pet Vibe project, following an Agile approach. This ensured that the project was developed incrementally, with flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and priorities. The project board can be accessed [here](https://github.com/users/thiago-23/projects/15)

## Deployment - Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next, select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install dj_databse_url`
    - `pip3 install psycopg2-binary` 
- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- In settings.py file import dj_database_url, comment out the default configurations within database settings and add the following: 

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
- Run migrations and create a superuser for the new database. 
- Create an if statement in settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not

```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
    }
```
- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: `web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi:application`
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in settings.py in the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

- Push these changes to Github.

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:

|     Variable name     |                           Value/where to find value                           |

### Connecting S3 to Django 
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install boto3`
    - `pip3 install django-storages` 
- Update your requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` and add storages to your installed apps.
- Create an if statement in settings.py 

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

- In settings.py add the following inside the if statement:

```
# Static and media files
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

# Override static and media URLs in production
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000'
}
```

- Go to S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'.
- Inside the folder, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using for your site.
- Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.
- Your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.
